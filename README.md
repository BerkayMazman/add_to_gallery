## Installation

Add `add_to_gallery` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

### iOS

Add the following keys to your _Info.plist_ file, located in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - describe why your app needs permission for the photo library. This is called _Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description_ in the visual editor.

### Android

* `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Permission for usage of external storage

## Usage

There's only one method. It copies the source file to the gallery and returns the new path.

```dart
String path = await AddToGallery.addToGallery(
  originalFile: File('/Some/Media/Path.jpg'),
  albumName: 'My Awesome App',
  deleteOriginalFile: false,
);
print(path);
```

### An Important Note about Google photos

Google Photos has a built-in feature to remove exact duplicates. It can be confusing to see your media disappearing like this. I considered addressing this behaviour in the plugin, but decided against it. I expect plugin users to be creating unique images with the camera or other methods.

## Credits & Comparison

Add to Gallery is based on [gallery_saver](https://pub.dev/packages/gallery_saver) with some notable differences. Enough to warrant a new package rather than a pull-request. Generally speaking, I've simplified the package somewhat and unified the behaviour on iOS and Android.
